                    Born in Kyiv - Ukraine, I spent my childhood and teens there. 
                    It is a lovely city, known for it historic heritage.
                    For university I moved to Moscow - Russia.
                    There I studied physics and math because I had a dream of becoming a scientist.
                    But due to many different factors, eventually I decided to reboot my career path and try something else.
                    Many of my friends and acquaintances went into IT after uni, and I got inspired by this idea as well.
                    And now I'm here)

                <h1>Physics</h1>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, I was always fascinated by nature and how it works. 
                    Every evening was filled with anticipation of a new episode of some science documentary on discovery channel:
                    Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Morgan Freeman (somehow), Myth Busters, Neil deGrasse Tyson and 
                    Bill Nye were the people who filled me with inspiration and desire to learn more about the universe.
                    So I studied math and physics at school intensely, and was encouraged by discovering that I was very good at them.
                    MIPT - Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, my university, was the place where dream met with reality.
                    Being a scientist is a hard job.
                    It requires A LOT of dedication from you, and the main fuel for this work is passion, of which I apparently didn't have just enough. 
                    But still, respect and appreciation of the field remains with me.

                <p>
                    While USSR occupied Ukraine, they were trying to extinguish our culture by outlawing ukrainian language. 
                    Russian language was enforced in schools and other institutions. 
                    Like with many of their endeavors, they failed.
                    But because there efforts were going on for generations, to this day in many regions of Ukraine people have russian as their first language.
                    And for this reason, many ukrainians speak russian and ukrainian right from childhood, despite those languages being quite different.
                    I was no exception, learning russian as my first language, and ukrainian as second. 
                    But I also was fortunate to study english in a specialized school, to advance myself in the modern world.
                    Benefits of this I am reaping right now, for which I am very grateful.
                    Additionally, a year ago I started learning spanish, because my step-dad is of hispanic origin and I wish to honour him this way.
                    All in all, studding my fourth language, I think it counts as me being a beginner polyglot)

                <p>
                    On the 24<sup>th</sup> of february 2022, Russia has begun a full scale military invasion of Ukraine. 
                    I can't say much more that hasn't been said already. 
                    I was very fortunate to have step-family here in the United Stated.
                    To have a place to go to. To have roof over my head, running water, electricity, and a lack of rockets hitting kindergartens and hospitals.
                    Many, however, were not as fortunate as me. But they are protected.
                    People who successfully fight the invaders despite overwhelming odds, and people who help them, are true heroes.
                    Слава Україні! Glory to Ukraine!
